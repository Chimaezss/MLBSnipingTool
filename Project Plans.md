Plans:
    1) Create a flipping tool to find a profitable price after tax
    2) Setup system to track cards - preliminary idea to just have a list in CLI
    3) Functionality for adding and removing from list
    4) Create and link database with all cards to be able to track easier
    5) Move project from CLI to different UI, either GUI or Website
    6) Possibly explore other options to turn tool into more of a companion than just a snipe tool
